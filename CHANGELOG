* Gave Herbie ability to roll by pressing the action button when no other action is available.
	Bad idea? Should each play have another button?
* Added gradient to horizontal doors for easier alignment
* Adjusts zoom level upon loading level in case the game runs in a huge resolution
* Containers now contains a function rather than a string.
	The "open" argument tells whether the container was opened or closed.
	If the function returns true it will be called again. Otherwise the function will be removed from the container. Example:
	local function toiletfunc(open)
		if open == true then addMessage("You opened the toilet!") return true
		else addMessage("You closed the toilet!") end
	end
	add("toilet", 1, 1, toiletfunc)
* If a string is given as the first argument it will load that level instead of the apartment.
	Example: "love rob.love test" will load test.png and test.lua
* Pressing action at the telephone will load the level "test" for those who might want to play around with it.
